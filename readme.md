# CampusOnSpring

A spring-boot CMS solution for CampusFM e.V. 

---
\
Unlike its predecessor, which was built entirely from scratch, also using Java, without any involvement\
of spring or other third-party applications, but rather built solely on self-written libraries, which\
were prone to bugs and limitations:

CampusOnSpring is a content management system built entirely\
in Java using SpringMVC, JSP and Hibernate.

### TODO

- [x] Implement custom authentication and authorization
