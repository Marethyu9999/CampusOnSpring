# CampusOnSpring

---
Unlike its predecessor, which was built entirely from scratch, also using Java, without any involvement\
of spring or other third-party applications, but rather built solely on self-written libraries, which\
were prone to bugs and limitations:

CampusOnSpring is a content management system built entirely\
in Java using SpringMVC, JSP and Hibernate.

### TODO

---


- [x] Implement custom authentication and authorization
- [x] Create the according controllers for login/registration
- [ ] Create a profile details editor with avatar upload option
- [ ] Create the campus compose interface to compose blog entries
